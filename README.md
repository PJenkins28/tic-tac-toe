# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project aims to implement a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game
that employes modular JS and is responsive in nature.

## Future Steps

In the first version of this app I tried to use as little global code as possible and succeded for the most part. In future versions, I believe I will encapsulate the remaining global code in a Class.

Other Features to be Implemented:

- Make an AI option with varying levels of difficulty as Player 2.
- Store round scores in local storage.
